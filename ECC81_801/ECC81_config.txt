# Polarity:
POLARITY = 1

# Test voltage V1 start:
VSTART = 0

# Test voltage V1 end:
VEND   = 300

# Test voltage V1 step:
VSTEP  = 5

# Max. allowed current during the test:
IMAX   = 0.015

# Max. allowed power during the test:
PMAX   = 2.5

# Idle conditions for pre-heat and idle between readings are configured to fixed values (PSU2 output will be regulated to attain these values, see below):

# - Idle voltage (will be set as voltage limit at PSU-1 during idling):
VIDLE  = 200

#   (no min. or max. idle voltage is specified, which tells the program to use a fixed V1 idle voltage)

# - Idle current, which is the target value to be attained with PSU-2 regulation
#   (make sure this is lower and not too close to IMAX):
IIDLE  = 0.010

#   (IDLE_GM = delta-I1 / delta-U2 ratio of the DUT at the idle point)
IDLE_GM   = -0.005

# - Max. allowed idle current during the test is 1 A (this is way more than necessary for the DUT, but a larger value helps achieving quick regulation of the PSU output):
