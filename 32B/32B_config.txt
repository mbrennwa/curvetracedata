# Connections:
# - PSU1-RED --> ANODE
# - PSU1-BLK --> CATHODE + PSU2-RED
# - PUS2-RED --> CATHODE + PSU1-BLK
# - PSU2-BLK --> GRID (VIA GRID STOPPER RESISTOR)
# - separate PSU for heater/filament

[PSU1]

# Polarity:
POLARITY = 1

# Test voltage V1 start:
VSTART = 0

# Test voltage V1 end:
# max = 550 V
VEND   = 550

# Test voltage V1 step:
VSTEP  = 5

# Max. allowed current during the test:
IMAX   = 0.15

# Max. allowed power during the test:
PMAX   = 50

# Idle conditions for pre-heat and idle between readings are configured to fixed values (PSU2 output will be regulated to attain these values, see below):

# - Idle voltage (will be set as voltage limit at PSU-1 during idling):
VIDLE  = 300

#   (no min. or max. idle voltage is specified, which tells the program to use a fixed V1 idle voltage)

# - Idle current, which is the target value to be attained with PSU-2 regulation
#   (make sure this is lower and not too close to IMAX):
IIDLE  = 0.100

[PSU2]

# Polarity:
POLARITY = -1

# Test voltage V2 start:
VSTART = 0.0

# Test voltage V2 end:
VEND   = 120

# Test voltage V2 step:
VSTEP  = 10

# Max. allowed current during the test is 1 A (this is way more than necessary for the DUT, but a larger value helps achieving quick regulation of the PSU output):
IMAX   = 1

# Max. allowed power during the test is 5 W (again, this is way more than necessary):
PMAX   = 5

# Idle conditions configured such that PSU-2 regulates the idle conditions configured for PSU-1

# - V2 start value:
VIDLE     = 80.0

# - V2 minimum value:
VIDLE_MIN = 0.0

# - V2 maximum value:
VIDLE_MAX = 90.0

# - The DUT transconductance value (in A/V) to be used for regulation of the I1 idle current by adjusting the V2 voltage:
#   (IDLE_GM = delta-I1 / delta-U2 ratio of the DUT at the idle point)
IDLE_GM   = -0.006

# - Max. allowed idle current during the test is 1 A (this is way more than necessary for the DUT, but a larger value helps achieving quick regulation of the PSU output):
IIDLE     = 1
