# Max. allowed power during the test:

# Idle conditions for pre-heat and idle between readings are configured to fixed values (PSU2 output will be regulated to attain these values, see below):

# - Idle voltage (will be set as voltage limit at PSU-1 during idling):
VIDLE  = 10

#   (no min. or max. idle voltage is specified, which tells the program to use a fixed V1 idle voltage)

# - Idle current is (the target value to be attained with PSU-2 regulation)
#   (make sure this is lower and not too close to IMAX):

# Test voltage V2 steps:

# - Max. allowed idle current during the test is 1 A (this is way more than necessary for the DUT, but a larger value helps achieving quick regulation of the PSU output):
